# PlayFramework dev workflow classloader leaks

Several factors can cause a classloader leak and prevents any memory from being reclaimed after a run.
This causes OOM after a few runs, depending on the application size, and makes play dev workflow unusable.

In this branch, the leak is caused by `kamon.Kamon.counter("foo")` in MyApplicationLoader.scala.

## Demo project

This is a bare-bone playframework project for demonstrating classloader leaks in dev run workflow.
No routes, no controllers, no templates.
Just an application loader from which the classloader leak is triggered.

## My setup

- Linux 5.4.2
- openjdk version "13.0.1" 2019-10-15
- scala 2.13.1
- playframework 2.8.0
- sbt 1.3.5

## Reproduce the leak

```
sbt
run
```

- Load http://127.0.0.1:9000 (it's a 404, there's no routes).
- Press `<enter>` to stop the run.
- Observe that classes are not unloaded, using any of these:
  - `jmap -clstats $(jps | grep sbt-launch.jar | cut -f1 -d' ') | head -n -1 | egrep MyComponents`
  - `jmap -clstats $(jps | grep sbt-launch.jar | cut -f1 -d' ') | wc -l`
  - `visualvm`
  - any tool showing loaded/unloaded classes

Further `run`s will show that more and more classes get loaded, and none unloaded.
